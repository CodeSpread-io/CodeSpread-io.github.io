How to sign up?

Signing up is totally free but only registered users can buy and sell on CodeSpread. When you sign up, choose whether you are a buyer, seller or both and fill in some details about yourself.

What is a CR?

CR stands for “Code Request” that includes detailed requirements, preferred code language, required skills, code complexity, due date and budget. After you create the CR, you can invite developers and start receiving proposals.

What are the CR statuses?

CR status are as follows:

**Pending** – After you create your CR, the status is on pending until you create an order.

**In process** – Once you pay and create an order.

**Delivered** – Once the developer completes the code and marks it as delivered.

**Completed** – Once you have confirmed the delivery.

What information is taken from GitHub?

For authenticated users with GitHub accounts, we take information about public repos the user may own and pull requests the user has made to other public repos.

How are developers ranked?

We have developed an algorithm that ranks the developer based on their activities on GitHub.&nbsp;We calculate the ranking based, among other things, on the developer’s contributions, information about the repos they own, pull requests that were made and issues that were open in GitHub repos. This helps us&nbsp;assess their expertise in topics associated with those repos. Please note that the developer’s rank may change over time as it is calculated relative to all the developers registered in the system.

Please keep in mind that a lower rank does not mean that a user does not have a good profile. It only means that the developer might be using other platforms such as bitbucket or GitLab. They may also have private contributions or simply don’t not like to code on open-source projects!&nbsp; Nevertheless, this should not discount a profile with a high rank 😉

The ranking helps us to project who might be a good fit to a specific code request for a specific topic, a combination of topics, or for a specific open source repository.

How do I find a developer for a specific open source repo?

Define your CR as “Based on Repo” and indicate the repo’s name.&nbsp;When searching for developers, make sure to filter by repo’s name, this way you will receive all the developers that are relevant to that specific repo.

How do I invite developers to a specific CR?

There are several ways to invite developers to your CR:

- Once you complete the creation of the CR you can choose to invite developers and will be directed to the “invite developer” page.
- From the CR card in the “Invite” tab.
- From the “My developers” menu by choosing the specific CR you want to invite to.
- From the developer’s public profile by pressing on “Invite to request” button

Can I edit my CR’s?

Yes! As long as the CR status is on “pending”, you can edit it as you wish.&nbsp;Once you edit the CR, all the developers you have invited will be notified.

How do I hire a developer?

You can hire a developer by accepting their proposal under the proposals tab in the CR card and paying the order amount.

What is the scan code feature?

Each time the developer presses on the “delivery” button we scan the code and send you a scan report. The scan report includes details about the quality of the code in terms of vulnerability and information security.
